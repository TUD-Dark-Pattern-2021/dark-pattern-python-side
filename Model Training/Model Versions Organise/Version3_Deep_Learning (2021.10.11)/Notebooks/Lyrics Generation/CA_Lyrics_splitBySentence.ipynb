eye, \\nHe gave her love, she took his name. \\n\\nThe times they were good, the times they were bad, \\nMost times it was just in between. \\nThe hard pill he swallowed was the times that they had, \\nShe put on display for all to be seen. \\n\\nSome find their solace in work or the lord, \\nShe was quite content in her dream. \\nWhen his eyes they burned from the bright lime light, \\nHe found comfort in the bottle of Ol\\' Jimmy Beam. \\n\\nOne day from the depths of his deep darkened hole, \\nHe reached out for something to feel. \\nShe offered back nothin\\' but lack of respect \\nSo he left himself out with two barrels of steel. \\n\\nShe cried in the day, she cried in the night. \\nShe cried loudest when someone was near. \\nWhether crying for him or she cried for herself, \\nThe bigger the camera, the bigger the tear. \\n\\nMost folks agree that she was living a hell \\nAnd publicly she showed her pain. \\nAnd never once was there a thought for herself, \\nAnd the ever-growing slices of fortune and fame. \\n\\nNow on the coattails of a dead man she\\'ll ride \\nOn the coattails of a dead man she\\'ll ride. \\nOn the coattails of a dead man she\\'ll ride she\\'ll ride, \\nOn the coattails of a dead man she\\'ll ride she\\'ll ride high.

changed because of a dollar sign \\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\nAnd its so strange when you get just a little money \\nYour so called friends want to act just a little funny \\nThey\\'ll blame you \\n\\nBut I\\'m not the one that\\'s here to blame \\nIts you my friend that\\'s really changed \\nIts a shame, such a shame \\nAm I losin\\' once again \\n\\nWhy these things happen, Lord I don\\'t understand \\nBut Lord it can sure hurt a man \\nWhy my friend won\\'t take me as I am \\n\\'Cause your friend Lord is the most important thing \\n\\n[Chorus] My desire is your frustration\\nIt\\'s hard for you to take\\nThe way I\\'ve changed\\nYour strange ways\\nHave left me cold and hollow\\nI know you never cared\\nBut it scared the hell out of me \\n\\nNow it\\'s coming clear to me\\nThis fear is in my mind\\nIt\\'s opened up a can of worms\\nOpen up my mind \\n\\nWell! curse this town\\nIt\\'s just no good for me\\nI\\'m gonna leave it all behind in pieces\\nI\\'m gonna walk a line\\nYeah, get

Dave\\nHe\\'s the meanest man in the state of Georgia\\nI\\'d rather fight a mountain lion in Miller\\'s Cave\\n\\nI said, \"you\\'ll pay, both you and David.\\nI\\'m gonna see you in your grave.\"\\nThey laughed at me, and then I shot \\'em\\nI took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller\\'s Cave\\n\\nWell, that woman made me feel unwanted\\nBut I showed her I was brave\\nMost wanted man in the state of Georgia\\nThey\\'ll never find me \\'cause I\\'m lost in Miller\\'s Cave In a long and involved conversation with myself\\nI saw precious things come into view\\nAnd I poured through the files taken off my mental shelf\\nI dusted off some memories of you\\n\\nThen I thought about the times when all the fair was green\\nHow the phoenix of our love, first flapped it\\'s silver wings\\nAll the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened\\nAnd how it all mellowed as it grew\\n\\nI remember the times that our laughter would explode\\nAnd how you would turn to hide your smile\\nAnd then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed\\nAnd both of us meandered on for miles\\n\\nI remember the time I said, I really had to go\\nI remember the tears that filled your eyes\\nThen I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie\\nAnd though you never knew it dear, I cried\\n\\nWell it\\'s amazing how time can so softly change your ways\\nAnd make you look at things that can\\'t be seen\\nAnd how the years that roll by can start you listening\\nNot just to what they say, but what they mean\\n\\nSo forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied\\nAnd if the razor edge of youth filled love is gone\\nBut we\\'re both a little older, our relationship has grown\\nNot just in how it\\'s shaped, but how it\\'s shown\\n\\nSo forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied\\nAnd if the razor edge of youth filled love is gone\\nBut we\\'re both a little older and our relationship has grown\\nNot just in how it\\'s shaped, but how it\\'s

and what did betide,\\nFor it bein\\' on Christmas mornin\\'\\nNow, for recreation, we went on a tramp,\\nAnd we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp\\nAnd a little wee drummer intending to camp,\\nFor the day bein\\' pleasant and charmin\\'.\\n2\\n\"Good morning, good morning,\" the Sergeant he cried.\\n\"And the same to you, gentlemen,\" we did reply,\\nIntending no harm but meant to pass by,\\nFor it bein\\' on Christmas mornin\\'\\n\"But,\" says he, \"My fine fellows, if you will enlist,\\nTen guineas in gold I\\'ll stick to your fist,\\nAnd a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,\\nAnd drink the king\\'s health in the morning.\\n3\\n\"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,\\nAnd he always is blessed with a charming young wife,\\nAnd he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,\\nAnd he always lives pleasant and charmin\\',\\nAnd a soldier, he always is decent and clean,\\nIn the finest of clothing he\\'s constantly seen.\\nWhile other poor fellows go dirty and mean,\\nAnd sup on thin gruel in the morning.\"\\nInstrumental\\n4\\n\"But,\" says Arthur, \"I wouldn\\'t be proud of your clothes,\\nFor you\\'ve only the lend of them, as I suppose,\\nBut you dare not change them one night, for you know\\nIf you do, you\\'ll be flogged in the morning,\\nAnd although that we\\'re single and free,\\nWe take great delight in our own company,\\nWe have no desire strange places to see,\\nAlthough that your offers are charming.\\n5\\n\"And we have no desire to take your advance,\\nAll hazards and dangers we barter on chance,\\nFor you\\'d have no scruples for to send us to France,\\nWhere we would get shot without warning,\"\\n\"Oh no,\" says the Sergeant\\n\"I\\'ll have no such chat,\\nAnd neither will I take it from snappy young brats,\\nFor if you insult me with one other word,\\nI\\'ll cut off your heads in the morning.\"\\n6\\nAnd Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,\\nAnd we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades\\nWhen a trusty shillelagh came over their head\\nAnd bid them take that as fair warning.\\nAnd their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,\\nWe flung them as far as we could in the tide,\\n\"Now take them up, devils!\" cried Arthur McBride,\\n\"And temper their edge in the mornin\\'!\"\\n7\\nAnd the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,\\nAnd we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,\\nThrew it in the tide for to rock and to roll,\\nAnd bade it a tedious returning,\\nAnd we havin\\' no money, paid them off in cracks.\\nWe paid no respect to their two bloody backs,\\nAnd we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,\\nAnd left them for dead in the morning.\\n8\\nAnd so, to conclude and to finish disputes,\\nWe obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,\\nFor we were the lads who would give them hard clouts\\nAnd bid them look sharp in the mornin\\'.\\nInstrumental\\n9\\nOh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,\\nAs we went a-walkin\\' down by the seaside,\\nMark now what

adjustment\\nOh It\\'ll work every time \\n\\nWell I\\'ve got this big \\'ol brother-in-law\\nAnd me and him just never did get along \\nBecause he wants to make sure \\nI\\'m treating his sister

bended knee\\nSun is sinking, shadows falling\\nBut their prayers still follow me.\\n\\nAs I travel on life\\'s pathway\\nKnow not what the years may hold\\nAs I ponder, hope grows fonder\\nPrecious

from charging dusk\\nMountains echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks\\nThey place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight\\nThe panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night\\n\\nEarth rim walker seeks his meals\\nPrepare the funeral pyres\\nThe shapers songs no longer heal the fear\\nWithin their eyes, their eyes\\n\\nWooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea\\nAppeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviors born of dreams\\nThey know their lives are forfeit now, priestly heads they bow in shame\\nThey cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel\\'s name\\n\\nEarth rim walker seeks his meals\\nPrepare the funeral pyres\\nThe shapers songs no longer heal the fear\\nWithin their eyes, their eyes\\nTheir eyes, their eyes, their eyes\\n\\nAs Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere\\nAlong the forest path he roams to Hrothgar\\'s hall so clear\\nHe knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify\\nHis claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky\\n\\nAs Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere\\nAlong the forest path he roams to Hrothgar\\'s hall so clear\\nHe knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify\\nHis claws will drip with mortal blood, as moonbeams haunt the sky\\n\\nEarth rim walker seeks his meals\\nPrepare the funeral pyres\\nThe shapers songs no longer heal the fear\\nWithin their hearts, within their hearts\\nWithin their hearts, within their eyes\\n\\nSilken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew\\nDenizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through\\nMother nature\\'s bastard child, shunned by leaf and stream\\nAn alien in an alien land, seeks solace within dreams\\n\\nThe shapers lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp\\nBeguiling queen, her innocence offends his icy heart\\n\\nHounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell\\nSulfurous essence pervades \\'round the grassy dell\\nHeorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher\\'s knife\\nStellular heavens ignore even children\\'s cries\\n\\nScreams are his music, lightning his guide\\nRaping the darkness, death by his side\\n\\nChants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams\\nFlickering firelight portraying the grisly scene\\nWarriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe\\nFutile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know\\n\\nHeroes delusions with feet in the grave\\nLurker at the threshold\\nHe cares not for the brave\\nHe cares not for the brave\\n\\nSo you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out\\nYou should have known better after all this time\\nYou\\'re gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander\\nWith your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes\\n\\nWhy should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame?\\nGod\\'s on my side, sure as hell, I\\'m gonna take no blame\\nI\\'m gonna take no blame, I\\'m goin\\' to take no blame\\n\\nSo you say you believe in all of mother nature\\'s laws\\nYou lust for gold with your sharpened knives\\nOoh, when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot\\nYou pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods\\n\\nThen you try to place the killers blade in my hand\\nYou call for justice and distort the truth\\nWell, I\\'ve had enough of all your pretty, pretty speeches\\nReceive your punishment, expose your throats to my righteous claws\\nAnd let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, and let the blood flow\\nAnd let the blood flow, and let the blood flow\\n\\nLet the blood flow, let the blood flow\\nLet the blood flow, let the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow\\nLet the blood flow, let the blood flow\\nLet the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow\\n\\nLet the blood, let the blood, let the blood\\nLet the blood, let the blood, let the blood\\nLet the blood, let the blood, let the blood\\nFlow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow Looks like an angel dances

Sixteen years\\nSixteen banners united over the field\\nWhere the good shepherd grieves\\nDesperate men, desperate women divided\\nSpreading their wings \\'neath falling leaves.\\nFortune calls\\nI stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace\\nMerchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down\\nShe\\'s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born\\nOn midsummer\\'s eve near the tower.\\nThe cold-blooded moon\\nThe captain waits above the celebration\\nSending his thoughts to a beloved maid\\nWhose ebony face is beyond communication\\nThe captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.\\nThey shaved her head\\nShe was torn between Jupiter and Apollo\\nA messenger arrived with a black nightingale\\nI seen her on the stairs and I couldn\\'t help but follow\\nFollow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.\\nI stumbled to my feet\\nI rode past destruction in the ditches\\nWith the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo\\nRenegade priests and treacherous young witches\\nWere handing out the flowers that I\\'d given to you.\\nThe palace of mirrors\\nWhere dog soldiers are reflected\\nThe endless road and the wailing of chimes\\nThe empty rooms where her memory is protected\\nWhere the angel\\'s voices whisper to the souls of previous times.\\nShe wakes him up\\nForty-eight hours later the sun is breaking\\nNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks\\nShe\\'s begging to know what measures he now will be taking\\nHe\\'s pulling her down and she\\'s clutching on to his long golden locks.\\nGentlemen, he said I don\\'t need your organization, I\\'ve shined your shoes\\nI\\'ve moved your mountains and marked your cards\\nBut Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination\\nOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.\\nPeace will come\\nWith tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire\\nBut will bring us no reward when her false idols fall\\nAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating\\nBetween the King and the Queen of Swords.

say\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI believe in You now\\nA new light is showing me how\\nI used to walk in the shadows of doubt\\nBut I believe in you now\\n\\nWill there ever come a day\\nWhen you follow in the way\\nOf the truth that sets you free?\\nTo where the thunder of a voice\\nAnd the echo of a choice\\nWill bring you to your knees\\nNo longer running through the night\\nA conversion to the light\\nGiving way to disbelief, and you say\\n\\n[Chorus] Last year we went to London and Paris, Texas\\nWe went on a bus tour, the great Texas honky tonk tour\\nHere are some snapshots about life on the road.....\\n\\nLet me tell you \\'bout the life I lead\\nIt ain\\'t all it\\'s cracked up to be\\nOf what you been told, \\'bout life on the road\\nRolling round in a painted bus, \\nJust so y\\'all can look at us\\nLife on the road\\n\\nYou pack your clothes and your shaving kit\\nSome extra socks and those pants that fit\\nCheck \\'em for holes, life on the road\\nEverything you pack is black, washed it all upon your back\\nFor life on the road\\n\\nClimb on board the bus and grab your bunk\\nOne on the bottom is the one you want\\nLess rock and roll as you roll down the road\\nPlug John Wayne in the VCR\\nLet the driver tell you where you are\\nLife on the road\\n\\nYou get a bed and a TV set, you get an ashtray for your cigarette\\nYou get HBO, well that\\'s life on the road\\nGet one down on the bottom floor, \\nHang a do not disturb sign on the door\\nLife on the road\\n\\nYou get clean sheets and a wake-up call\\nDon\\'t go up north in the spring and fall\\nBut not when it\\'s cold, that\\'s no life on the road\\nCoffee black with pie a la mode\\nThat\\'s what you want before the show\\nLife on the road\\n\\nTonight we\\'re playing that high school gym\\nThey\\'re all drunk before I even begin\\nThey\\'re hollering \"Pissin\\' in the Wind\"\\nLife on the road\\n\\nThe local band opens up for us\\nNow the PA\\'s got a real big buzz\\nLife on the road\\n\\nThe good news is I get to sing my songs\\nThe bad news is they all sing along\\nAnd they\\'re singing wrong notes\\nAhh, life on the road\\n\\nBut if I stop, it won\\'t be long\\nBefore

thoughts of all the days this time\\nThey have been confined without reason\\nAnd in the matters of their health and wealth\\nThey cannot be defined but as treason\\nBut go where and find the better life\\nAs in the name of love you have freed them\\nAnd those you need not you have left behind\\nAnd those you keep in mind you know to heed them\\n\\nAcross the bridge, across the river\\nWhere we\\'ve never been before\\nWithin and out of worlds around us\\nAnd in the light of finding more\\nWe always easy understood that\\nIt was no good not to explore\\nBut never really understood

storm\\nWhen the rivers freeze and summer ends\\nPlease see if she\\'s wearing a coat so warm\\nTo keep her from the howlin\\' winds\\nPlease see for me if her hair hangs long\\nIf it rolls and flows all down her breast\\nPlease see for me if her hair hangs long\\nThat\\'s the way I remember her best\\nI\\'m a-wonderin\\' if she remembers me at all\\nMany times I\\'ve often prayed\\nIn the darkness of my night\\nIn the brightness of my day\\nSo if you\\'re travelin\\' in the north country fair\\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\\nRemember me to one who lives there\\nShe once was a true love of mine It came upon the midnight clear\\nThat glorious song of old\\nFrom angels bending near the earth\\nTo touch their harps of gold\\n\"peace on the earth, goodwill to men\\nFrom heavens all gracious king!\"\\nThe world in solemn stillness lay\\nTo hear the angels sing\\n\\nYet with the woes of sin and strife\\nThe world hath suffered too long\\nBeneath the angel strain have rolled\\nTwo thousand years of wrong\\nAnd man, at war with man, hears not\\n\\nThe love song which they bring 0 hush the noise, \\nYe men of strife and hear the angels sing.\\nMidnight clear\\n\\n\"peace on the earth, goodwill to men\\nFrom heavens all gracious king!\"\\nThe world in solemn stillness lay\\nTo hear the angels sing\\nMidnight clear You know you made me cry\\nI see no use in wondering why\\nI cry for you\\nAnd now you\\'ve changed your mind\\nI see no reason to change mine\\nI cry it\\'s through, oh\\nYou\\'re giving me the same old line\\nI\\'m wondering why\\nYou hurt me then\\nYou\\'re back again\\nNo, no, no, not a second time\\nNot a second time\\nYou know you made me cry\\nI see no use in wondering why\\nI cry for you\\nAnd now you\\'ve changed your mind\\nI see no reason to change mine\\nI cry it\\'s through, oh\\nYou\\'re giving me the same old line\\nI\\'m wondering why\\nYou hurt me then\\nYou\\'re back again\\nNo, no, no, not a second
